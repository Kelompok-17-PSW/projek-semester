          <h3>Characteristics</h3>
          <p><strong>1. Using Past Tenses</strong></p>
          <p>Narrative texts often contain past tenses because they typically recount events that have already occurred. 
            This creates a sense of time and sequence, making it easier for readers to follow the plot and understand the events.</p>
          <blockquote>
            "Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived a kind, generous old man. One day, he stumbled upon a giant squash."
          </blockquote>
          <p><strong>2. Using Adverbials of Time</strong></p>
          <p>Adverbials of time help create a clear structure and progression, guiding the reader through the events.</p>
          <blockquote>
            "Early one morning, Sarah went for a jog in the park. Later that day, she met her friends for lunch."
          </blockquote>
          <p><strong>3. Using Adjectives</strong></p>
          <p>Adjectives make the story vivid and descriptive, giving more information about the nouns in the narrative.</p>
          <blockquote>
            "The brave knight entered the dark, mysterious forest."
          </blockquote>
          <p><strong>4. Using Noun Phrases</strong></p>
          <p>Noun phrases provide rich detail and allow for concise descriptions that help create vivid imagery in the story.</p>
          <blockquote>
            "The bright morning sun cast a golden glow over the calm waters of the lake."
          </blockquote>
